# Hello :wave:

My name is Will Dean. My background is in Statistics and have been working as a Data Scientist in the transportation and real estate industries. 

I enjoy working with geographical data and exploring user behavior.

The tools I reach for frequently are Python and Docker. I will use libraries like: 

- `PyMC`
- `geopandas`
- `typer`

I am not foreign to opening up a GitHub Issue or PR :smile:

I love to learn and collaborate so feel free to [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williambdean/) or keep up with [my blog](https://wd60622.github.io/blog/)
