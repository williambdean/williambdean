# Hello :wave:

My name is Will Dean. My background is in Statistics and have been working as a Data Scientist the last 4 years in the transportation and real estate industries. 

I enjoy working with geographical data. Most likely because it helps me forget about my [*Fernweh*](https://www.linguee.de/deutsch-englisch/search?source=auto&query=fernweh). I love to travel and figure out how the world works while talking to people in the process. 

I am currently interested in exploring different Bayesian models, specifically with the library `PyMC`. I find the software fun to use and very helpful for the problems I like to solve. 

Some of my other favorite python software recently is:  

- `PyYAML`
- `rich`
- `fastapi` / `typer` (big fan of all the creator's work)
- `geopandas`

As of late, I have been exploring python code design techniques to create easy-to-use APIs that can be easily extended. This [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ArjanCodes) has been an inspiration for me. 

I love to learn and collaborate so feel free to [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williambdean/)! I've been looking into freelancing and have some options posted [here](https://www.fiverr.com/williamdean600?up_rollout=true) as well.
