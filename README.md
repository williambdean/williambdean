# Hello :wave:

My name is Will Dean.

I'm working on [PyMC-Marketing](https://github.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing)
with the [PyMC Labs](https://www.pymc-labs.io) team. We are building a package
to help make better decisions with Bayesian statistics.

I've created a few other data science projects:

- [conjugate-models](https://github.com/wd60622/conjugate)
- [pandas-bootstrap](https://github.com/wd60622/pandas-bootstrap)
- [latent-calendar](https://github.com/wd60622/latent-calendar)

and work on some other tools for making my development life easier:

- [octo.nvim](https://github.com/pwntester/octo.nvim)
- [closing-labels](https://github.com/wd60622/closing-labels)

I am not foreign to opening up a GitHub Issue, PR, or both :smile:

I love to learn and collaborate so feel free to [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williambdean/) or keep up with [my blog](https://wd60622.github.io/blog/)
