# Hello :wave:

My name is Will Dean. My background is in Statistics and have been working as a Data Scientist in the transportation and real estate industries. 

I enjoy working with geographical data, exploring user behavior, and seeing where they intersect.

The tools I reach for frequently are Python and Docker. I will use libraries like: 

- `PyMC`
- `geopandas`
- `typer`

Or will create my own like: 

- [latent-calendar](https://github.com/wd60622/latent-calendar)
- [conjugate-models](https://github.com/wd60622/conjugate)
- [pandas-bootstrap](https://github.com/wd60622/pandas-bootstrap)

I am not foreign to opening up a GitHub Issue, PR, or both :smile:

I love to learn and collaborate so feel free to [connect with me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williambdean/) or keep up with [my blog](https://wd60622.github.io/blog/)
