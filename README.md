# Welcome

I am currently interested exploring Bayesian models, specifically with PyMC. I find the software fun to use and very helpful for the problems I solve. 

My background is in Statistics and have been working as a Data Scientist the last 4 years in the transportation and real estate industries. 

I enjoy working with geographical data and helps me forget about my `fernweh`. 

As of late, I have been exploring python code design techniques to create easy-to-use APIs that can be easily extended. 

I love to learn and collaborate so feel feel to connect with me somewhere!
