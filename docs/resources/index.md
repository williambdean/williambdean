## Tools

### Notion

I started using Notion for organizing my life. I find it is a great tool for personal projects, journaling, and all things above. 

There is so many customization options to it out of the box and the features keep on improving. 

It is also very awesome that it can be used on all platforms.

## YouTube

### [ArjanCodes](https://www.youtube.com/@ArjanCodes)

This guy puts out some high quality content for python programming. I've really enjoyed all of his material and he posts very consistently. 

I've found my coding style to be heavily influenced by him and I have found many resources because of him.
